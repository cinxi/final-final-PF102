            <h1>About this Subject</h1>
            <p>→ Event Driven Programming is a way computers work by reacting to events, when you click a button or type
                something.<br>
                Instead of doing things step by step, it waits for specific actions to occur. Like having a computer
                that only does things when <br>
                you tell it to or when certain things happen. By so, when you interact with a program, like clicking a
                link, it triggers actions in response.<br>
                This programming style makes software more interactive and responsive to user input. </p>

            <h1>What have I learned</h1>
            <p> → I've learned on how to connect multiple files and on how to connect each one of them to css, js, and
                html.
            </p>

            <h1>What I did not understand</h1>
            <p> → I did not really understand the concept of DOM or Document Object Model. As for my lacking, I will do
                my very best and <br> put more effort to fill it up. </p>

                <h1>What I should do</h1>
            <p> → As for my lacking, I will do my very best and put more effort to fill it up. </p>
